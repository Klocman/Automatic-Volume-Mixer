## Automatic-Volume-Mixer
Automatic Volume Mixer is a tool that allows automatization of Windows Volume Mixer based on user's rules. You can open the Volume Mixer by right-clicking on the speaker icon in the system tray and selecting Open Volume Mixer. This application is an automatic version of that applet.

## Examples
One of the easiest examples is automatically pausing your audio player (e.g. foobar2000) whenever some other application makes a noise, and resuming playback once the noise is gone. This enables you to keep your audio player running in the background at all times.
